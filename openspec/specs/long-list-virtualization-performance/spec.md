# long-list-virtualization-performance Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change optimize-long-list-virtualization. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Long Message Lists MUST Use A Viewport Projection Boundary

Long-list optimization MUST be implemented as a render-layer viewport projection and MUST NOT change reducer state shape, message identity, or conversation ordering.

#### Scenario: virtualization preserves message identity and order

- **WHEN** a 1000-row conversation is rendered through virtualization
- **THEN** visible rows MUST preserve the same message ids and ordering as the underlying conversation state
- **AND** reducer state MUST remain unchanged by viewport calculations

### Requirement: Streaming Row MUST Remain Stable During Virtualization

Virtualization MUST preserve live streaming semantics for the active assistant row.

#### Scenario: active streaming row receives deltas without visual reset

- **WHEN** assistant text deltas append to the active row
- **THEN** virtualization MUST NOT lose the row's live content, scroll intent, or selection state

### Requirement: Scroll Restoration MUST Preserve Existing User Semantics

The system MUST preserve existing scroll position restoration and initial visible row semantics after virtualization.

#### Scenario: restored session opens at the expected scroll position

- **WHEN** a long restored session is opened
- **THEN** the visible position MUST match the pre-change behavior or be explicitly documented as an intentional improvement

### Requirement: S-LL-1000 MUST Have Browser-Level Scroll Verification

The `S-LL-1000` scenario MUST move beyond jsdom-only proxy confidence by adding a browser-level scroll verification gate or a documented environment limitation.

#### Scenario: browser scroll gate records long-list behavior

- **WHEN** long-list perf validation runs
- **THEN** `S-LL-1000` MUST include browser-level scroll evidence or an explicit unsupported marker with rationale

### Requirement: Long-List Metrics MUST Not Regress Against v0.4.18 Baseline

The system MUST compare long-list metrics against the v0.4.18 baseline and prevent unbounded regressions.

#### Scenario: commit and scroll metrics are compared

- **WHEN** `npm run perf:long-list:baseline` runs
- **THEN** `S-LL-1000` commit / scroll metrics MUST not be worse than baseline without a documented reason
- **AND** `openspec validate optimize-long-list-virtualization --strict --no-interactive` MUST pass

### Requirement: Long Streaming Timelines SHALL Keep Heavy Derivations Off The Delta Path

Long conversation timelines SHALL preserve a stable parent presentation snapshot during live output growth so per-delta work remains bounded.

#### Scenario: live row grows without full timeline recomputation
- **WHEN** a single assistant or reasoning row receives repeated realtime deltas
- **THEN** the latest live row MUST remain visible through an override or equivalent active-row path
- **AND** grouping, anchors, sticky candidates, final boundary sets, suppressed context sets, and collapsed middle-step projections MUST NOT be recomputed from the full latest timeline on every text delta

#### Scenario: stable snapshot converges after completion
- **WHEN** the streaming turn completes
- **THEN** the stable presentation snapshot MUST converge to canonical latest timeline items
- **AND** final boundaries, anchors, sticky candidates, and collapsed rows MUST reflect the completed conversation without requiring history replay as the only source of truth

### Requirement: Streaming Virtualization SHALL Preserve Active Row Semantics

Any virtualization, content visibility, chunking, or row windowing used during streaming SHALL preserve active row visibility, scroll intent, selection, and copy semantics.

#### Scenario: active streaming row is not recycled away
- **WHEN** timeline virtualization or content visibility is enabled while a row is actively streaming
- **THEN** the active live row MUST remain mounted or otherwise preserve live text, selection, auto-follow intent, and message actions
- **AND** the user MUST NOT see the active response reset, disappear, or wait for history restore

#### Scenario: non-live rows may be bounded
- **WHEN** a long timeline contains many historical rows during an active streaming turn
- **THEN** non-live historical rows MAY be virtualized, hidden with content visibility, or collapsed by a documented projection
- **AND** message order, message identity, anchor navigation, and scroll restoration MUST remain explainable from canonical conversation state

### Requirement: Scroll Work SHALL Be Throttled Without Blocking Input

Auto-follow, scroll restoration, and message jump work SHALL be scheduled so it does not monopolize the main thread during typing or high-frequency streaming.

#### Scenario: auto-follow does not flood smooth scroll work
- **WHEN** a live conversation receives frequent deltas
- **THEN** auto-follow scroll work MUST be throttled, coalesced, or switched to instant behavior during active streaming
- **AND** pending scroll work MUST NOT block Composer input event handling

#### Scenario: manual scroll intent is preserved
- **WHEN** the user scrolls away from the bottom during streaming
- **THEN** throttled auto-follow MUST respect the user's manual scroll intent
- **AND** performance optimization MUST NOT force the viewport back to the live row unless the user re-enables follow behavior

### Requirement: Timeline Virtualization SHALL Account For Render Weight

Timeline virtualization SHALL consider render weight in addition to row count so image-heavy or long-content conversations can bound renderer memory and layout work before reaching the large-row threshold.

#### Scenario: image-heavy timeline virtualizes before row-count threshold
- **WHEN** a conversation contains message images, deferred image placeholders, generated image cards, or other image-heavy rows
- **AND** the row count is below the normal long-list threshold
- **THEN** the timeline MAY enable virtualization based on accumulated render weight
- **AND** message order, identity, actions, anchor navigation, and scroll restoration MUST remain based on canonical conversation state

#### Scenario: active streaming row remains reachable under weighted virtualization
- **WHEN** weighted virtualization is enabled while a turn is active
- **THEN** the active live row MUST remain visible or reachable through the existing live-row override semantics
- **AND** virtualization MUST NOT reset live text, copy/fork/rewind controls, or user scroll intent
