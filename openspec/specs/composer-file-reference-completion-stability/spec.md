# composer-file-reference-completion-stability Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change fix-composer-file-reference-at-white-screen. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Composer file-reference completion MUST normalize runtime sources

The composer file-reference completion provider MUST ignore malformed, blank, or non-string file and directory paths before creating completion items.

#### Scenario: malformed source paths are skipped
- **WHEN** the composer receives file-reference completion source entries that are blank, duplicated, or not strings
- **THEN** the completion provider MUST skip invalid entries
- **AND** it MUST return only valid unique file-reference completion items
- **AND** it MUST NOT throw during dropdown item generation

#### Scenario: malformed lazy directory children are skipped
- **WHEN** nested file-reference completion loads workspace directory children and the payload contains malformed entries
- **THEN** the completion provider MUST skip invalid child entries
- **AND** it MUST keep valid child entries available in the dropdown
- **AND** it MUST NOT crash the composer or app shell

### Requirement: Composer inline file-tag rendering MUST fail locally

The composer MUST isolate inline file-tag rendering failures so a `contenteditable` DOM rewrite or cursor-restoration exception does not blank the app shell.

#### Scenario: file tag render exception leaves composer recoverable
- **WHEN** the composer attempts to render an inline `@` file-reference tag and the DOM rewrite or cursor restoration fails
- **THEN** the failure MUST be logged through existing frontend diagnostics
- **AND** the composer MUST clear transient tag-render state that would keep retrying the same failed render
- **AND** the app shell MUST remain mounted and interactive

#### Scenario: raw file reference remains editable after render degradation
- **WHEN** inline file-tag rendering degrades after a failure
- **THEN** the raw file-reference text MUST remain editable in the composer
- **AND** subsequent normal typing MUST continue to update composer content

### Requirement: Composer slash command completion MUST normalize runtime sources

The composer slash command completion provider MUST ignore malformed project custom commands and SDK/bridge slash command payload entries before rendering dropdown items.

#### Scenario: malformed project custom commands are skipped
- **WHEN** project custom command entries contain missing, blank, or non-string `name` values
- **THEN** the slash command completion provider MUST skip those malformed entries
- **AND** valid commands MUST remain searchable and selectable
- **AND** the composer MUST NOT crash on macOS, Windows, or Linux

#### Scenario: malformed SDK slash commands are skipped
- **WHEN** the SDK/bridge slash command callback receives a mixed payload containing malformed entries
- **THEN** malformed entries MUST be skipped
- **AND** valid SDK slash commands and local slash commands MUST remain available
- **AND** duplicate command labels MUST be collapsed before dropdown rendering

### Requirement: Shared completion dropdown mapping MUST fail per item

The shared composer completion dropdown MUST isolate failures while mapping provider results into dropdown items.

#### Scenario: malformed dropdown item does not drop valid items
- **WHEN** a completion provider returns multiple results and mapping one result to a dropdown item fails
- **THEN** that result MUST be skipped and logged
- **AND** valid mapped results MUST remain visible
- **AND** selecting a visible item MUST pass the matching raw provider item to the completion selection handler

#### Scenario: non-array provider result is treated as empty
- **WHEN** a completion provider unexpectedly resolves to a non-array value
- **THEN** the dropdown MUST log the invalid provider result
- **AND** it MUST show an empty completion list rather than crashing the composer
