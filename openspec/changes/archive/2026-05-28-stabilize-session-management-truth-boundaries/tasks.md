- [x] 1.3 [P1] Create or activate the linked Trellis task for this OpenSpec change; input: change id; output: `.trellis/tasks/*` task referencing `stabilize-session-management-truth-boundaries`; verify with `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py`.

## 2. Backend Source Status And Archived Evidence

- [x] 2.1 [P1] Fix source completeness generation so capped/bounded non-empty scans do not return authoritative `Complete`; input: `scanCapReached`, scan mode, row count; output: conservative `WorkspaceSessionCatalogSourceStatus`; verify with Rust unit covering bounded cap + non-empty rows.
- [x] 2.2 [P1] Add archived evidence status to catalog/sidebar-support response path or equivalent helper; input: archive metadata lookup result; output: bounded archive evidence with complete/degraded/uncertain status; verify with Rust unit for archive lookup failure.
- [x] 2.3 [P1] Prevent partial/degraded archived evidence from resurrecting archived continuity rows; input: previous complete archive evidence and current degraded lookup; output: archived row remains filtered or explicitly uncertain; verify with Vitest in thread-list sidebar hook.

## 3. Related Sessions Engine-Neutral Projection

- [x] 3.1 [P1] Replace Codex-only related session backend contract with engine-neutral related projection while preserving strict scope boundaries; input: existing Codex related helper and catalog entries; output: related entries for supported inferred engines; verify with Rust tests for Claude + Codex related entries.
- [x] 3.2 [P1] Remove frontend Codex-only related engine filter; input: `mode === "project" && source === "related"` query; output: supported non-Codex engine filters request/display related results; verify with Vitest for Claude related filter.
- [x] 3.3 [P1] Ensure related mutations route by real owner workspace and do not pollute strict membership; input: related entry mutation; output: owner-aware mutation result and unchanged strict list; verify with Rust or Vitest mutation regression.

## 4. Stable Catalog Pagination

- [x] 4.1 [P2] Introduce stable opaque cursor format using ordering anchor; input: sorted catalog entry fields; output: parse/build cursor helpers that accept legacy offset and emit stable cursor; verify with Rust unit for cursor round-trip.
- [x] 4.2 [P2] Update catalog page slicing to use anchor comparison instead of mutable offset skip; input: filtered sorted entries and cursor; output: next page without duplicate/skip after insertion; verify with Rust test simulating new entry before page two.
- [x] 4.3 [P2] Preserve filter context across cursor chain; input: engine/status/keyword/folder filters; output: cursor or request validation that prevents mismatched continuation; verify with Rust unit for mismatched filter behavior.

## 5. Frontend Last-Good And Page Cap Semantics

- [x] 5.1 [P2] Refactor last-good health from whole-list to engine/source snapshots; input: current `ThreadSummary[]` and source statuses; output: engine-specific healthy snapshots; verify with Vitest where Claude degraded does not block OpenCode/Codex snapshot.
- [x] 5.2 [P2] Make continuity seed prefer same-engine snapshot and still honor authoritative archived/hidden/deleted/out-of-scope removal; input: engine-specific snapshot + removal evidence; output: seeded rows only when retainable; verify with Vitest for removal override.

- [x] 6.3 [P2] Update frontend selection/notice behavior for mixed batch results; input: result list; output: success entries removed/updated, failures visible and selected; verify with Vitest for Session Management hook or section.

## 7. Validation And Closeout

- [x] 8.3 [P1] Prevent degraded last-good fallback from reviving explicitly deleted sessions; input: `deletedThreadIds` plus uncertain/degraded empty source status; output: deleted rows removed from cached summaries, reducer state, fallback snapshots, visible summaries, and remembered last-good candidates; verify with `useThreadActions` regression.
- [x] 8.4 [P1] Close stale Settings session curtain when the currently opened session is deleted; input: successful delete results while curtain is loading; output: curtain closes, timeout cleanup runs, stale load sequence is invalidated; verify with `SessionManagementSection` regression.
- [x] 8.5 [P1] Make folder deletion remove only organization containers; input: folder delete core and folder metadata subtree; output: folder subtree is removed, assignments inside it are promoted to the deleted folder's parent or root, and real sessions are never deleted or used to block deletion; verify with focused Rust folder-delete regressions.

## Evidence - 2026-05-23

- OpenSpec baseline: `openspec status --change stabilize-session-management-truth-boundaries`, `openspec validate stabilize-session-management-truth-boundaries --strict --no-interactive`, `openspec validate --all --strict --no-interactive`.
- Trellis task: `.trellis/tasks/05-23-stabilize-session-management-truth-boundaries/task.json`; verified with `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py`.
- Backend: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml session_management` passed with 63 `session_management` tests in both lib and daemon targets.
- Frontend: `npx vitest run src/features/threads/hooks src/features/settings/components/settings-view src/services/tauri.test.ts` passed with 68 files / 930 tests.
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck` passed.
- Stable cursor: Rust tests cover legacy offset compatibility, stable cursor round-trip, new-session insertion before page two, and filter-context mismatch restart.
- Sidebar continuity: Vitest covers healthy Codex snapshot persistence when Claude catalog evidence is degraded.
- Page cap: Settings hook/section Vitest covers `requestedLimit=999`, `effectiveLimit=200`, `limitCapped=true`, and visible cap notice.
- Batch mutation partial result: Rust test covers one owner workspace success and one owner failure for folder assignment; backend archive/unarchive/delete metadata write paths now convert owner-group failures into per-entry failures.
- Large-file governance: `node --test scripts/check-large-files.test.mjs`, `npm run check:large-files:near-threshold`, and `npm run check:large-files:gate` passed; hard gate found 0 blocking files after `session_management.rs` was split to 2950 lines and batch assignment moved to `session_management_batch_assign.rs`.
- Heavy-test-noise sentry: `node --test scripts/check-heavy-test-noise.test.mjs scripts/test-batched.test.mjs` and `npm run check:heavy-test-noise` passed; full sentry covered 532 test files with 0 act/stdout/stderr payload violations.
- Runtime contracts: `npm run check:runtime-contracts` passed.
- Hygiene: `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` applied; `git diff --check` passed.

## Evidence - 2026-05-25

- Focused Settings curtain regression: `npx vitest run src/features/settings/components/settings-view/sections/SessionManagementSection.test.tsx` passed with 28 tests.
- Focused session-management regression set: `npx vitest run src/features/threads/hooks/useThreadActions.test.tsx src/features/settings/components/settings-view/sections/SessionManagementSection.test.tsx src/app-shell-parts/useWorkspaceThreadListHydration.test.tsx src/app-shell-parts/useAppShellSearchRadarSection.test.tsx` passed with 78 tests.
- Quality gates: `npm run lint`, `npm run check:runtime-contracts`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Typecheck qualifier: `npm run typecheck` is currently blocked by unrelated untracked `src/features/project-map/components/ProjectMapPanel.tsx` importing missing `../mockProjectMapData`; this is outside the session-management write set.

## Evidence - 2026-05-26

- Focused backend folder regression: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml workspace_session_folder -- --nocapture` passed, covering empty-subtree deletion, top-level session promotion to root, nested session promotion to parent, and descendant subtree promotion behavior in lib + daemon targets.
- Formatting and hygiene: `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --check` and scoped `git diff --check -- src-tauri/src/session_management.rs src-tauri/src/session_management_tests.rs src-tauri/src/bin/cc_gui_daemon/session_folders.rs` passed.
